There is opportunity in Singapore for most areas of IT. What you learn in terms of IT skills is not as important as what you do with it. It is the attitude and the ability to learn from mistakes, and to contribute back to the company that you work for that is likely to make more of a difference than specific IT skills.
There are two main paths for advancement in IT - either technical or management. Technical means you continue to deepen your technical area in a domain (such as system architecture, or software engineering, etc.) and you become an expert in those areas. The other is management, where you can focus on project management, outsourcing, etc.
Our internship companies often tell us that if we can give them good students as interns, it is very likely they will get a job offer at the end of the internship.
Upon graduation, you will be trained IT specialists and leaders in real-world operating environments, equipped with invaluable problem solving, solutioning, and critical thinking skills. This would make you highly sought-after candidates of dynamic and successful multi-national corporations and institutions."
