Career Pathways of Master of Technology in Software Engineering (MTech SE),"Find your fit with new opened doors
There are opportunities in Singapore for most areas of IT. What you learn in terms of IT skills is not as important as what you do with it. It is the attitude and the ability to learn from mistakes, and to contribute back to the company that you work for that is likely to make more of a difference than specific IT skills.
There are two main paths for advancement in IT - either technical or management. Technical means you continue to deepen your technical area in a domain (such as system architecture, or software engineering, etc.) and you become an expert in those areas. The other is management, where you can focus on project management, outsourcing, etc.
Our internship companies often tell us that if we can give them good students as interns, it is very likely they will get a job offer at the end of the internship.
As an MTech SE graduate, you will be equipped with the essential knowledge and practical experience to architect, design, build and manage the delivery of robust software systems for organisations.

The NUS-ISS Career Services Office helps students to match jobs based on their skills and experience. There will be bi-yearly Career Fairs held for students and graduates to network with employers. However, successful employment will depend on the employers.
The average starting salary of an IT professional depends on the degree and your previous working experience. For fresh graduates with no work experience, the starting salary ranges from S$3,600 to S$3,800. Graduates with more than 3 years of work experience can expect a starting pay of S$4,000 and above.
The most important skill is to get the job done and be persistent. You need to be broad-based and the technology does not matter."
