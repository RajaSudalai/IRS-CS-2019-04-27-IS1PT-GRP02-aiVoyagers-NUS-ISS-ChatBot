Do you feel that your IT processes (e.g. for projects, software development, operations, infra management etc) are too complex, too bureaucratic, too slow, have too much documentation and don�t satisfy your users and customers? 

One good way to improve this situation is to make use of Lean IT best practices.

Lean IT is the extension of Lean principles applied to IT products and services. Lean IT can be interpreted as an IT process improvement strategy; a way to design, transform and run the IT business so as to maximise customer value and reduce waste. It focuses on improving value, efficiency and speed, through reduction of waste within the value delivery processes of an IT organisation.  

The Lean concept has a great impact on the culture of an organisation as it empowers employees to participate in the optimisation of processes. The principles of Lean IT are applicable to all organisations with IT operations regardless of industry or sector.

Lean IT is complementary to other frameworks and methods such as ITIL�, PMP�, CMMI� and COBIT�. These frameworks provide guidelines on best-practice processes but do not provide much guidance on how the implementation details of the processes can be optimised to reduce waste and increase value to the customer/user. Lean IT provides this complementary aspect.  

Lean IT is also complementary to agile methods such as SCRUM. For example, SCRUM recommends reflecting on completed SCRUM processes for improvement (e.g. via sprint retrospective) but SCRUM does not give much guidance on how to improve. Again, Lean IT provides this complementary aspect.

Lean companies are arguably more successful than non-lean companies in terms of business value and retaining talent, and their success is more sustainable over time.

This course teaches Lean IT Foundation principles and concepts. Class exercises, workshops and quiz are used extensively to reinforce the participants' understanding and practice of the concepts as well as assess the competence of the participants. The course also includes the Lean IT Foundation Exam which leads to the Lean IT Foundation Certificate for successful participants.

The 60-minute, 40 questions, multiple-choice Lean IT Foundation certificate exam is scheduled on the last day of the course.

Upon completion of this course, participants would be able to:

Broaden their skills on process improvement with a strong emphasis on focusing on value as seen from the customer�s perspective
Minimising waste and producing more efficient IT services, which in turn benefits the organisation
This course is part of the  Digital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS.

Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 14.5 PDUs (PM: 10.5, Leadership: 2, Business: 2) that can be used to maintain your PMP� credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP� credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is �2339�.

NICF- DevOps Foundation with BizOps (SF),"Duration 3 days
Course Time 9.00am - 5.00pm
PDU 17.5
PDU and PD hours are available for this course
Enquiry Please contact Ms. Serene ANG at tel: 66012391 or email  for more details. Whether you are in IT or Project management, application development or IT infra/operations, the growing business demand for ever faster time-to-market means that you now need to know DevOps and BizOps, in addition to Agile.  

While Agile caters only to development work, DevOps and BizOps will cater to the whole end-to-end IT work process.

DevOps (an international best practice) caters to an agile/lean, automated end-to-end process for application development/enhancement work - starting from development work and extending to the downstream IT infra/operations work (e.g. infra setup, deployment and operations/monitoring).  

BizOps caters to an agile/lean process for business needs that are directly catered for by IT infra/ops and IT/project managers without involvement of software developers.  These can be new services (e.g. implementation of new infra such as IoT sensor network), upgrade of existing services (e.g. upgrade of wifi network) and work relating to existing services (e.g. service requests, incident management etc.) 

While most DevOps courses touch indirectly on BizOps, this course will explicitly cover BizOps in addition to DevOps so as to provide a coverage of lean/agile across all IT services and the roles that all the different IT management/specialists play in it as well as tools that are important to such agility.

As DevOps and BizOps do not have a widely-recognised, de-facto certification body or international standard as yet, this course captures and integrates international best practices from the industry (e.g. from companies such as Spotify) so as to provide useful and practical foundational competencies in DevOps and BizOps.

You will earn 17.5 PDUs (Technical : 17.5) upon successful completion of this course. For the purpose of PDU reporting, the ISS PMI� REP Provider Number is �2339�.

We are in an era where AI and analytics are transforming industries and people�s life at an unprecedented pace. In the recently released report from Gartner, Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2018, the top two trends are AI Foundation, and Intelligent Apps and Analytics.

AI Foundation focuses on creating systems that learn, adapt and potentially act autonomously, and leveraging AI to enhance decision making, reinvent business models and ecosystems, and remake the customer experience. The technologies and techniques in AI Foundation have grown substantially over the years, as the availability of massive amounts of data has fed machine learning, resulting in the flourishing of more advanced algorithms in the form of deep learning.

The second trend, Intelligent Apps and Analytics, clearly states AI�s huge impact in the next-generation data and analytics paradigm, Augmented Analytics. Machine learning is key in this new paradigm, automating data preparation, insight discovery and insight sharing for a broad range of end-users and citizen data scientists, while expert data scientists focusing on specialized problems and on embedding models into applications. The need to perform processing on natural language data is reflected in the illustrated paradigm, identifying three tasks in this area � natural language processing (NLP), natural language query (NLQ), natural language generation (NLG).

In the field of NLP, deep learning techniques has taken a dominant position over tradition statistical methods. Researchers have been reporting much higher performance metrics applying deep learning to solve problems like text classification, language modeling, speech recognition, caption generation, machine translation, document summarization, question answering, etc.

This course, Text Processing Using Machine Learning, provides essential knowledge and skills required to perform deep learning based text processing in common tasks encountered in industries. A combination of lectures, case studies, and workshops will be used to cover the application of DL techniques such as word-embedding, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, character-based language modelling, encoder-decoder models, reinforcement learning, etc.

Nb: The course has two versions � a special healthcare version, and a normal default version for all industry sectors.  The details of the two versions are described below.

Version for all industries:

When we have difficult digitalisation problems to solve, it pays to have good frameworks and methods to allow the problem to be worked through systematically and successfully. For example, techniques to cater to
Complicated problems such as
tough technical problems (e.g. a mission critical system is down) where experts have difficulty finding the root cause
Complex problems such as
improving an organisation for which its mission-critical digital services fail repeatedly over time, and the organisation is not able to improve and minimise such incidents
methods to handle an environment that is VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) such as to achieve digital transformation and/or create successful new digital services in spite of the VUCA environment or market
analysing and creating or improving a complex stakeholder ecosystem for a digital service
Chaotic problems such as
Major incidents, disasters or crisis causing significant chaos to the organisation and its digital services
This course will provide systems thinking and root cause analysis skills to cater to the above. Techniques covered will include Kepnor Tregoe; analysis and change of systems behaviour (e.g. via System Archetypes, causal loop mapping and ecosystem analysis and design); analysis and change of people behaviour (e.g. via understanding and changing mental models, understanding and working with cognitive biases, allies and adversaries analysis and approach); Cyenfin Framework approaches to complicated, complex and chaotic problems and how these are manifested in techniques such as Sense-making, Lean Startup and Design Thinking as well as in other techniques. Workshops will allow the participants to gain the skills in relevant approaches. 

Health Services Version:

For practitioners working in healthcare or social care, the specially tailored �Systems Thinking and Root Cause Analysis for Health Services� version of this course will be most relevant. The course will teach the tools and strategies to help inform decision making in complex situations and especially help participants grapple with the unique challenges associated with care settings. The health services course includes application of tools and strategies to integrated care models as well as mapping different decision-making domains to the macro, meso and micro levels of healthcare systems. The course is designed to support participants in framing their challenges within the macro level of the system, and scoping their solutions down to meso or micro levels. �Systems Thinking and Root Cause Analysis for Health Services� is offered as a standalone course. It is also one of the five stackable training courses that make up the NUS Professional Diploma in Smart Health Leadership. Upon completion of all five stackable training courses, participants are expected to undertake a capstone project in order to achieve the Professional Diploma award.

Note: Please bring your laptop (Mac or Windows) to the course as you will be doing website evaluation and hands on prototyping workshops.

This 3-day introductory course focuses on the principles and techniques in the design of good user experience in software applications. It traverses through the requirement, analysis, design and validation phases of the user experience design life cycle with emphasis on building empathy with users. Case scenarios, examples, exercises and workshops will be used throughout the course for participants to individually experience and reflect on what is good and bad UX design.

Designing for applications is about more than just usability. It is also about how well a particular application is able to relate, interact and serve for a meaningful experience. Good user experience encourages a higher engagement rate and sustained use of the applications. It also renders a beneficial experience for the user, which can lead to an increase in productivity. Bad user experience often leads to a myriad of issues and arguably one of the most damaging, is to the organisation�s or company�s image.

This course is part of the Digital Innovation & Design Series offered by NUS-ISS.

Product Managers are increasingly becoming the �mini-CEO� of their product.  They own the decisions about what to build but also influence every aspect of how to build and launch.  They must have a broad knowledge base to in-order to make trade-off decisions, bring together cross-functional teams while ensuring alignment between diverse functions within the organisation.

As more companies outside of the technology sector set out to build software capabilities for success in the digital era, it is critical that they get the product-management role right.

Product managers are crucial to digital business success, orchestrating stakeholders and teams to deliver better product and financial outcomes. Organisations must understand this challenging role in order to help find the right people for the job.

An understanding of change management principles can greatly improve the project manager�s chance of success in introducing IT or digital change.

In a rapidly changing business environment driven by IT and digitalisation, the ability for a business to continually adapt to take advantage of new opportunities requires the development of a strong change culture and a skilled, change-ready workforce.  This not only helps to ensure success but just as critically helps to avoid being left behind and rendered obsolete. The effective application of change management and communication techniques to IT and digitisation projects will significantly improve the chance of success for change initiatives. Thus, managers who are leading change management project teams must be equipped with the necessary skills and appropriate toolkit to embark on the transformation journey.

This course draws extensively upon the practitioner experience of our lecturers. Having delivered complex, large scale change programmes locally and internationally, our course lecturers will share the frameworks and tools they have applied in industry settings. In the process, common pitfalls will be highlighted, with expert advice on how to overcome or avoid them.

The course is designed to address the particular challenges associated with the implementation of new IT systems or technologies, although the principles of change management, and the frameworks taught, could be applicable for all change management situations. The programme is delivered using blended learning techniques including experiential role-play, and hinges around IT case study activities to support participants in practical application of the skills taught.

Enquiry Please contact Ms. Jeryn LIN at tel: 66017926 or email  for more details. Business agility refers to the ability of an organisation to succeed in a rapidly changing environment, by providing the required culture and supporting practices. Business agility builds upon practices that are widely used in software development to improve efficiency and speed to market and innovation.

The benefits of enhanced agility include higher revenues, more satisfied customers and employees, improved operational efficiency and faster time-to-market.

Business agility, hence, must be addressed organisation-wide and not be limited to IT, although IT serves as the key enabler of digital transformation. Agile organisations that are effective are both stable (resilient, reliable and efficient) and dynamic (fast, nimble and adaptive). Research shows that stability and dynamism are significant catalysts for organisational health and performance. Agile organisations also appear to be better at innovation, according to the best research.

This course will present the importance of business agility in relation to digital transformation and provide guidance on extending Agile practices across the organisation. A proven approach for establishing an Agile organisational culture will be discussed. We will discuss best practices for managing change as the organisation carries out its transition from the current to the desired Agile state.

This course is designed for use in a Bootcamp, which can be tailored for specific organisational needs, and a part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership and Digital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS.

Mobile devices are already an essential tool carried or worn by users worldwide and displacing conventional computers for everyday needs. With the number of smartphones and tablets on the increase, attacks on mobile devices are maturing. Gartner predicts that the focus of endpoint breaches will shift to smartphones and tablets in this year.

Mobile devices are affected by a range of security vulnerabilities, many of which are inherited from traditional attacks against web and desktop applications. However, several other classes of attack are specific to the mobile area and arise due to the way in which mobile applications are designed and the relatively unique entry points and attack surfaces that these applications create.

This course provides a technical review of the top security risks and controls to the iOS, Android and WebView mobile platforms, mobile apps development and integration to the enterprise that every IT professional needs to know. By combining lectures with discussion and hands-on workshops, the course prepares the mindset of participants to review the proposed mobile security architecture for businesses.

In light of heightened information security concerns, software development lifecycle processes must be approached through implementation of �Secure by Design� practices.

Without such focus on designing secure software applications, security exposures may lead to serious breaches or costly redevelopment.

Hence, software developers must be trained to understand security concerns, where they may impact on the solution, and be able to implement the application in a security-aware manner.  They must also be able to conduct security risk assessments and incorporate suitable mitigation measures in their software design.

Software is increasingly being developed within an agile project framework, such as Scrum. Such frameworks encourage iterative and incremental development in multiple iterations or sprints.

The objective of this course is to instill �Secure by Design� practices into the agile software development process so as to enable the team to produce applications that meet security requirements.

This course is part of the Cybersecurity series, Software Systems series, Digital Strategy & Leadership series as well as Graduate Certificate in Securing Ubiquitous Systems series offered by NUS-ISS. 

Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 10 PDUs (Technical: 8.5, Strategy: 1.5). Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting, the PMI� REP Provider Number of ISS is �2339�.

The introduction of new technologies and the continual evolution of existing IT systems presents incredible opportunities and simultaneous challenges to the modern organisation. Technology alone cannot transform a business. It is critical that the people involved in the implementation and utilisation of new solutions are willing to embrace them as well. An understanding of change management principles can greatly improve the project manager�s chance of success in introducing IT or digital change.

In a rapidly changing business environment driven by IT and digitalisation, the ability for a business to continually adapt to take advantage of new opportunities requires the development of a strong change culture and a skilled, change-ready workforce.  This not only helps to ensure success but just as critically helps to avoid being left behind and rendered obsolete. The effective application of change management and communication techniques to IT and digitisation projects will significantly improve the chance of success for change initiatives. Thus, managers who are leading change management project teams must be equipped with the necessary skills and appropriate toolkit to embark on the transformation journey.

This course draws extensively upon the practitioner experience of our lecturers. Having delivered complex, large scale change programmes locally and internationally, our course lecturers will share the frameworks and tools they have applied in industry settings. In the process, common pitfalls will be highlighted, with expert advice on how to overcome or avoid them.

The course is designed to address the particular challenges associated with the implementation of new IT systems or technologies, although the principles of change management, and the frameworks taught, could be applicable for all change management situations. The programme is delivered using blended learning techniques including experiential role-play, and hinges around IT case study activities to support participants in practical application of the skills taught.

This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership and Digital Products & Platforms Series offered by NUS-ISS. Series offered by NUS-ISS.

Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 19.5 PDUs (Business: 12.5, Leadership: 7) that can be used to maintain your PMP� credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP� credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is �2339�."
NICF- Cybersecurity Risk Awareness (SF),"Duration 1 day
Course Time 9.00am - 5.00pm
Enquiry Please contact Ms. Jane LIM at tel: 66013975 or email  for more details. In our current digitally disrupted era, cybersecurity has now become more critical and the stakes are much higher. Daily cyber attack occurrences demonstrate the risks posed by cyber-threats � from individual, opportunistic hackers, to professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies to systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even threaten our safety.

Investing in cyber technology alone to address cyber threats is no longer sufficient. The biggest risks of cyber attack lies in the effective management of humans � the weakest link in cyber threat. This requires putting in place the right governance and the right supporting processes, along with the right enabling cyber technology. Such complexity cannot be an excuse for anyone within an organisation to differ accountability and responsibility to technical �experts� � the cybersecurity professionals. It is essential that the organisation takes control of allocating the right resources to address cyber threats, actively manage governance, risk and responses to cyber threats and incidents. This includes creating an informed and knowledgeable organisational culture that emphasises that cybersecurity is everyone�s responsibility � no exception.

This course is part of the CyberSecurity and Digital Strategy & Leadership Series offered by NUS-ISS.

With Singapore�s push towards international connectivity and the pervasive adoption of digital technologies as recommended by Committee on Future Economy (CFE), we inadvertently expand our cyber attack surface. Singaporean organisations and Singapore citizens are thus more exposed to global threats posed by cyber threats � from individual, opportunistic hackers, to professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies to systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even threaten our safety.

In today�s digital business environment, cyber attacks can cripple the entire business operations if an organisation is unprepared. Investing in cybersecurity technology alone is insufficient to address cyber threats. Creating an informed and knowledgeable organisational culture that emphasises cybersecurity is a must for the entire organisation, and with business/operational leaders taking the lead is now an imperative.

This course is designed to provide you with the necessary skills to implement the right cybersecurity strategy and action plans, taking into considerations your business environment, your business and the potential cyber threats that will affect the business operations in the digital economy. In addition, it provides a detailed prescriptive framework which includes Incident Response Plan (using industry best practices) and a Cyber Maturity Model, instead of knowledge sharing without an approach to application. How public and private enterprises can play a role in ensuring that Singapore remain cyber resilience will also be discussed.
