We are in an era where AI and analytics are transforming industries and people�s life at an unprecedented pace. In the recently released report from Gartner, Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2018, the top two trends are AI Foundation, and Intelligent Apps and Analytics.

AI Foundation focuses on creating systems that learn, adapt and potentially act autonomously, and leveraging AI to enhance decision making, reinvent business models and ecosystems, and remake the customer experience. The technologies and techniques in AI Foundation have grown substantially over the years, as the availability of massive amounts of data has fed machine learning, resulting in the flourishing of more advanced algorithms in the form of deep learning.

The second trend, Intelligent Apps and Analytics, clearly states AI�s huge impact in the next-generation data and analytics paradigm, Augmented Analytics. Machine learning is key in this new paradigm, automating data preparation, insight discovery and insight sharing for a broad range of end-users and citizen data scientists, while expert data scientists focusing on specialized problems and on embedding models into applications. The need to perform processing on natural language data is reflected in the illustrated paradigm, identifying three tasks in this area � natural language processing (NLP), natural language query (NLQ), natural language generation (NLG).

In the field of NLP, deep learning techniques has taken a dominant position over tradition statistical methods. Researchers have been reporting much higher performance metrics applying deep learning to solve problems like text classification, language modeling, speech recognition, caption generation, machine translation, document summarization, question answering, etc.

This course, Text Processing Using Machine Learning, provides essential knowledge and skills required to perform deep learning based text processing in common tasks encountered in industries. A combination of lectures, case studies, and workshops will be used to cover the application of DL techniques such as word-embedding, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, character-based language modelling, encoder-decoder models, reinforcement learning, etc.

In light of heightened information security concerns, software development lifecycle processes must be approached through implementation of �Secure by Design� practices.

Without such focus on designing secure software applications, security exposures may lead to serious breaches or costly redevelopment.

Hence, software developers must be trained to understand security concerns, where they may impact on the solution, and be able to implement the application in a security-aware manner.  They must also be able to conduct security risk assessments and incorporate suitable mitigation measures in their software design.

Software is increasingly being developed within an agile project framework, such as Scrum. Such frameworks encourage iterative and incremental development in multiple iterations or sprints.

The objective of this course is to instill �Secure by Design� practices into the agile software development process so as to enable the team to produce applications that meet security requirements.

Enquiry	Please contact Ms. Jane LIM at tel: 66013975 or email  for more details. In our current digitally disrupted era, cybersecurity has now become more critical and the stakes are much higher. Daily cyber attack occurrences demonstrate the risks posed by cyber-threats � from individual, opportunistic hackers, to professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies to systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even threaten our safety.

Investing in cyber technology alone to address cyber threats is no longer sufficient. The biggest risks of cyber attack lies in the effective management of humans � the weakest link in cyber threat. This requires putting in place the right governance and the right supporting processes, along with the right enabling cyber technology. Such complexity cannot be an excuse for anyone within an organisation to differ accountability and responsibility to technical �experts� � the cybersecurity professionals. It is essential that the organisation takes control of allocating the right resources to address cyber threats, actively manage governance, risk and responses to cyber threats and incidents. This includes creating an informed and knowledgeable organisational culture that emphasises that cybersecurity is everyone�s responsibility � no exception.

With Singapore�s push towards international connectivity and the pervasive adoption of digital technologies as recommended by Committee on Future Economy (CFE), we inadvertently expand our cyber attack surface. Singaporean organisations and Singapore citizens are thus more exposed to global threats posed by cyber threats � from individual, opportunistic hackers, to professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies to systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even threaten our safety.

In today�s digital business environment, cyber attacks can cripple the entire business operations if an organisation is unprepared. Investing in cybersecurity technology alone is insufficient to address cyber threats. Creating an informed and knowledgeable organisational culture that emphasises cybersecurity is a must for the entire organisation, and with business/operational leaders taking the lead is now an imperative.

This course is designed to provide you with the necessary skills to implement the right cybersecurity strategy and action plans, taking into considerations your business environment, your business and the potential cyber threats that will affect the business operations in the digital economy. In addition, it provides a detailed prescriptive framework which includes Incident Response Plan (using industry best practices) and a Cyber Maturity Model, instead of knowledge sharing without an approach to application. How public and private enterprises can play a role in ensuring that Singapore remain cyber resilience will also be discussed.

Everyday decisions, from which products to buy, movies to watch and restaurants to try, are more and more being put in the hands of a new source: recommendation systems. Recommendation systems work by studying the past behaviours and purchases of users along with their preferences and product ratings. Using these and other relevant data they are able to provide recommendations and choices of interest to users in terms of �Relevant Job postings�, �Movies of Interest�, �Suggested Videos�, �People who bought this also bought this� etc.

Recommender systems have been widely used by online shopping companies such as Amazon.com. They play a critical role in analysing customer transactions and web browsing behaviours to provide sound recommendations for their customers, contributing to sales revenue and profitability. In this regard, a reliable and efficient recommendation system is essential for many companies� market and business success.

We are in an era where AI and analytics are transforming industries and people�s life at an unprecedented pace. In the recently released report from Gartner, Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2018, the top two trends are AI Foundation, and Intelligent Apps and Analytics.

AI Foundation focuses on creating systems that learn, adapt and potentially act autonomously, and leveraging AI to enhance decision making, reinvent business models and ecosystems, and remake the customer experience. The technologies and techniques in AI Foundation have grown substantially over the years, as the availability of massive amounts of data has fed machine learning, resulting in the flourishing of more advanced algorithms in the form of deep learning.

The second trend, Intelligent Apps and Analytics, clearly states AI�s huge impact in the next-generation data and analytics paradigm, Augmented Analytics. Machine learning is key in this new paradigm, automating data preparation, insight discovery and insight sharing for a broad range of end-users and citizen data scientists, while expert data scientists focusing on specialized problems and on embedding models into applications. The need to perform processing on natural language data is reflected in the illustrated paradigm, identifying three tasks in this area � natural language processing (NLP), natural language query (NLQ), natural language generation (NLG).

In the field of NLP, deep learning techniques has taken a dominant position over tradition statistical methods. Researchers have been reporting much higher performance metrics applying deep learning to solve problems like text classification, language modeling, speech recognition, caption generation, machine translation, document summarization, question answering, etc.

This course, Text Processing Using Machine Learning, provides essential knowledge and skills required to perform deep learning based text processing in common tasks encountered in industries. A combination of lectures, case studies, and workshops will be used to cover the application of DL techniques such as word-embedding, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, character-based language modelling, encoder-decoder models, reinforcement learning, etc.

Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage complex product development since the early 1990s. The Product Owner is responsible for maximising the value of the product and the work of the development team. Some of the work a Product Owner does includes defining the product backlog, prioritising them and making sure that development team understand the items clearly.

The Certified Scrum Product Owner course will empower you with the knowledge and tools to excel in this role. Conducted by Certified Scrum Trainer Pete Deemer, it consists of lectures modules and case-study-based exercises with ample open discussions and Q and A opportunities.

This course is not recommended for those who have already attended NICF - Business Analysis for Agile Practitioner course.

This course is part of the Digital Strategy and Leadership, Digital Agility and Digital Products and Platforms Series offered by NUS-ISS.

Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 9 PDUs (PM: 9) that can be used to maintain your PMP� credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP� credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is �2339�.

Business agility refers to the ability of an organisation to succeed in a rapidly changing environment, by providing the required culture and supporting practices. Business agility builds upon practices that are widely used in software development to improve efficiency and speed to market and innovation.

The benefits of enhanced agility include higher revenues, more satisfied customers and employees, improved operational efficiency and faster time-to-market.

Business agility, hence, must be addressed organisation-wide and not be limited to IT, although IT serves as the key enabler of digital transformation. Agile organisations that are effective are both stable (resilient, reliable and efficient) and dynamic (fast, nimble and adaptive). Research shows that stability and dynamism are significant catalysts for organisational health and performance. Agile organisations also appear to be better at innovation, according to the best research.

This course will present the importance of business agility in relation to digital transformation and provide guidance on extending Agile practices across the organisation. A proven approach for establishing an Agile organisational culture will be discussed. We will discuss best practices for managing change as the organisation carries out its transition from the current to the desired Agile state.

This course is designed for use in a Bootcamp, which can be tailored for specific organisational needs, and a part of the Digital Strategy and Leadership and Digital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS.

An Agile software development approach is characterised by iterative and incremental development to achieve significant productivity benefits, such as faster time-to-market and cost and time savings.

The Agile approach's benefits to the organisation are:

Increased ability to plan and deliver changes based on business priorities
Greater responsiveness with the ability to respond to changing priorities or urgent updates
Higher visibility of progress to all stakeholders
The confidence that they are building the right solutions by allowing them to explore new ideas and test them quickly with significantly less effort and cost
A delivery process that significantly lowers the risk of delivery, compared to traditional 'big bang' releases at the end of a long project
Improved ability to commit to and meet delivery deadlines
The ability to deliver new functionalities to their customers faster and with less lead time
A software testing practice that follows the principles of Agile software development is called 'Agile Testing'. An Agile framework, such as Scrum, is an iterative approach for software development, where requirements and designs evolve through collaboration between the customer and self-organising project teams.

Agile Testing focuses on identifying and repairing defects when they are detected, rather than waiting for a later stage in the project. By doing so, the product's quality will increase and development costs and efforts will go down. Agile practices, such as daily meetings can help to identify issues and defects early.

This three-day course will provide training and testing activities related to Agile projects and on applying tools and techniques to ensure that software products meet the accepted quality level (AQL).

Advantages of Agile Testing:

Improves quality
Saves time and money
Reduces documentation
Team gets regular feedback from end users

Just as buildings are constructed using proven designs, software too can be built utilising proven solutions to common problems. Reapplying design pattern solutions to new applications reduces the development cost and lends itself to extensibility.

This course teaches participants to solve tough design problems by adapting proven designs called design patterns. By reusing proven solutions on the right problems in the right contexts, you will be able to solve design problems that you may not have been able to do previously.

This course provides an in-depth look into how experts apply design skills. A case study and a programming exercise will provide an opportunity for hands-on design discussions.

Design patterns should be applied whenever a new software application is being architected and designed. They should also be applied when there is a need to �refactor� or improve existing software applications. The course highlights the relevance of design patterns in both contemporary and agile software engineering lifecycles.

In light of heightened information security concerns, software development lifecycle processes must be approached through implementation of �Secure by Design� practices.

Without such focus on designing secure software applications, security exposures may lead to serious breaches or costly redevelopment.

Hence, software developers must be trained to understand security concerns, where they may impact on the solution, and be able to implement the application in a security-aware manner.  They must also be able to conduct security risk assessments and incorporate suitable mitigation measures in their software design.

Software is increasingly being developed within an agile project framework, such as Scrum. Such frameworks encourage iterative and incremental development in multiple iterations or sprints.

The objective of this course is to instill �Secure by Design� practices into the agile software development process so as to enable the team to produce applications that meet security requirements.

This course is part of the Cybersecurity series, Software Systems series, Digital Strategy and Leadership series as well as Graduate Certificate in Securing Ubiquitous Systems series offered by NUS-ISS. 

Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 10 PDUs (Technical: 8.5, Strategy: 1.5). Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting, the PMI� REP Provider Number of ISS is �2339�.

Delving straight into system development without applying proper analysis and design is similar to building a house without a blueprint. This would mean having to spend more time and resources on reworks and patches later in the development phase in order to solve problems that could have been avoided if appropriate development techniques had been applied.

The Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) techniques helps to:

Speed up software development processes
Increase developers� productivity by promoting software reuse
Facilitate effective software integration
Reduce software maintenance and enhancement efforts
Support continuous integration and delivery
Workshops are specially tailored to take participants through the system development process; from requirements to design workflow. Participants will get hands-on experience on the application of OOAD techniques through the relevant cycles.

This course not only helps system designers and developers to leverage on the benefits of OOAD techniques, thereby reducing maintenance costs and increasing software quality, it also helps project managers / leaders / Scrum masters / team members to better manage software development processes.

Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 19 PDUs (PM: 19) that can be used to maintain your PMP� credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP� credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is �2339�.

Mobile devices are already an essential tool carried or worn by users worldwide and displacing conventional computers for everyday needs. With the number of smartphones and tablets on the increase, attacks on mobile devices are maturing. Gartner predicts that the focus of endpoint breaches will shift to smartphones and tablets in this year.

Mobile devices are affected by a range of security vulnerabilities, many of which are inherited from traditional attacks against web and desktop applications. However, several other classes of attack are specific to the mobile area and arise due to the way in which mobile applications are designed and the relatively unique entry points and attack surfaces that these applications create.

This course provides a technical review of the top security risks and controls to the iOS, Android and WebView mobile platforms, mobile apps development and integration to the enterprise that every IT professional needs to know. By combining lectures with discussion and hands-on workshops, the course prepares the mindset of participants to review the proposed mobile security architecture for businesses.

Enquiry	Please contact Ms. Verene HENG at email  for more details. Mobile devices have become the essential delivery platform for business. Businesses recognise that mobility solutions are becoming their main channel when reaching out to their employees, customers and partners. The driving forces include improving internal communication, boosting customer retention, increasing speed of decision-making, reducing costs, improving efficiency and acquiring new customers.

Therefore, we are convinced that mobility is the way of life. The question is how to extend our enterprise services onto the mobile platform. There is already a set of existing mature and stable enterprise web applications. However, do we duplicate the services onto the mobile platform? Do we redesign part of or all of the applications? Or do we simply make our web applications adaptable to the mobile browser? There is also a need to decide which mobile platform to adopt - mobile web or native app, as well as which backend solution platform is most suitable and affordable.

This course aims to equip the participants with knowledge in designing mobile enterprise solutions, evaluating mobile development technologies and identifying security concerns pertaining to mobile enterprise solutions. With this knowledge, the participants will be able to evaluate their existing suite of traditional and web application, and redesign them for the mobile platform. They would be able to compare and contrast different mobile development technologies and select the appropriate one for their organisation, based on their needs.

The course will be conducted with a significant proportion on the hands-on workshop, which will walk participants through topics like mobile application design, development platform evaluation and security consideration. It will deepen the participants' understanding of how to apply the unique characteristics of mobile solutions in an enterprise environment.

NICF- Agile Testing ,"An Agile software development approach is characterised by iterative and incremental development to achieve significant productivity benefits, such as faster time-to-market and cost and time savings.

The Agile approach benefits to the organisation are:

Increased ability to plan and deliver changes based on business priorities
Greater responsiveness with the ability to respond to changing priorities or urgent updates
Higher visibility of progress to all stakeholders
The confidence that they are building the right solutions by allowing them to explore new ideas and test them quickly with significantly less effort and cost
A delivery process that significantly lowers the risk of delivery, compared to traditional 'big bang' releases at the end of a long project
Improved ability to commit to and meet delivery deadlines
The ability to deliver new functionalities to their customers faster and with less lead time
A software testing practice that follows the principles of Agile software development is called 'Agile Testing'. An Agile framework, such as Scrum, is an iterative approach for software development, where requirements and designs evolve through collaboration between the customer and self-organising project teams.

Agile Testing focuses on identifying and repairing defects when they are detected, rather than waiting for a later stage in the project. By doing so, the product's quality will increase and development costs and efforts will go down. Agile practices, such as daily meetings can help to identify issues and defects early.
